How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
-Interpreting Needs: Understand user goals by communicating with them and considering their context. Break down their needs into clear, actionable items.
-User Stories: These help by converting user needs into specific tasks that developers can work on. They ensure the software is user-focused and deliverable in small, manageable increments.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
-Developing Programs: Start with gathering requirements, design the system, develop and test iteratively, and continuously refine based on feedback.
-Agile Processes: I aim to incorporate sprint planning, daily standups, CI/CD, and regular retrospectives to ensure continuous improvement and alignment with user needs.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
-Collaboration: Communicate effectively, support teammates, and respect diverse perspectives.
-Accountability: Be reliable, transparent, and take responsibility for your work.
-Adaptability: Be open to learning, flexible with changes, and contribute to a positive team environment.
